This repository is for the FSW System Analysis and Design course.
Within this course, I learned how to use different CASE tools, including but not limited to:
* Entity Relation Ship diagrams
* Network diagrams
* State Diagrams
* UML Diagrams
* Testing plans
* Kanban Boards

I also created a Systems requirement document for an elevator that goes sideways instead of just upwards.
